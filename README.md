# 🪐 Solar System Simulation

![Simulation Screenshot](screenshot.png)
A dynamic 2D simulation of the inner solar system built with **Python** and **Pygame**. 
This project models orbital mechanics using **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation** to visualize the trajectories of the Sun, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus in real-time.

## ✨ Features
- **N-Body Physics:** Calculates gravitational forces between all celestial bodies.
- **Accurate Scales:** Uses Astronomical Units (AU) for distance and realistic planetary masses.
- **Visuals:** Dynamic orbit trails and real-time distance indicators from the Sun.
- **Clean Code:** Modular `Planet` class design focusing on readability.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame** (Rendering engine)
- **Math** (Vector calculations)

## 🚀 Installation & Running

You don't need complex setups. Just install Pygame and run!
